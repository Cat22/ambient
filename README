**********************************************

ambient is a program designed to read 1 or more
usb TemperGold v3.1 tempresature sensors


Requirements:
gcc (should be gcc version greater than 4 and preferably
greater than 8)
pthreads library support
udev libs and the udev development library usually
something like (in your software install choices)
udev
libudev-devel
autotools v 2.69 or newer
gnuplot

To build ambient:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
Note: I left out make install because you can just copy
the ambient executable (in src/) where you like. remember
that ambient will create data files and a png image in the
same directory so take that into consideration

udev:
  copy the below rule to /etc/udev/rules.d
  This will make the hidraw(s) you need to run ambient
  read/write from user space. Otherwise you will have to
  run ambient as root.
  once you have the rule in rules.d either retrigger the udev
  hidraw or reboot:
  udevadm trigger --verbose --type devices -s hidraw

  You an modify some parameters by editing ambient.h:

**********************************************
// room temperatures in degrees F that define the text color output
#define COLD   60.0
#define COOL   65.0
#define WARM   70.0
#define HOT    75.0

// if you change these make **sure** you include 
the format char '%d' somewhere in the name
char *by_day_file_fmt   = "by_day-%d.dat";
char *by_week_file_fmt  = "by_week-%d.dat";
char *by_month_file_fmt = "by_month-%d.dat";
int enable_graphing = true;
int enable_multi_plot = true; // most of the time this is fine, even for a single sensor
