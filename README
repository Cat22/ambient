ambient is a program designed to read 1 or more
usb TemperGold v3.1 tempresature sensors


Requirements:
gcc (should be gcc version greater than 4 and preferably
greater than 8)
pthreads library support
udev libs and the udev development library usually
something like (in your software install choices)
udev
libudev-devel
autotools v 2.69 or newer

To build ambient:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
Note: I left out make install because you can just copy
the ambient executable (in src/) where you like. remember
that ambient will create data files and a png image in the
same directory so take that into consideration

udev:
  copy the below rule to /etc/udev/rules.d
  This will make the hidraw(s) you need to run ambient
  read/write from user space. Otherwise you will have to
  run ambient as root.
  once you have the rule in rules.d either retrigger the udev
  hidraw or reboot:
  udevadm trigger --verbose --type devices -s hidraw
